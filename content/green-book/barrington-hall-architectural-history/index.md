Barrington Hall was more than a physical structure.  After living in the largest student
cooperative in the United States for three years, I imagined it as possibly the largest family home
in the country, possibly the world.  Cooperative condominiums and their ilk share the financial
burdens and the common areas of larger structures among their residents, but within Barrington
every social and cultural activity of its 182 residents became a community effort.  We ate
together, we cooked together, we cleaned together, we sunbathed together, we lived in constant
contact with one another, our pets, and vermin we’d only imagined in the suburban homes we
grew up in; and we were frequently reminded of our togetherness by stereos roaring through walls
and loud parties in hallways late at night.  It may be difficult to avoid speaking through youthful
idealism or naïveté, but the building known then as Barrington Hall returned more to its
occupants than any other structure I have seen, then or since.  To many it was an ugly building,
painted battleship gray and decorated with by naked pipes, window bars, graffiti and garbage, but
its pragmatic ugliness brought it to the level where it could be loved as our simple home, rather
than admired for its style and appearance.

I will strive to bring that spirit of Barrington into this paper.  The history of the structure
is amazingly colorful, and by close analysis we can come to an understanding not only of the
workings of the largest group of students then living cooperatively, but perhaps even the changes
in American culture itself since the first timbers were raised in 1906.

Barrington Hall literally rose from ashes.  After the great San Francisco earthquake and fire of
1906, a torrent of refugees poured across the Bay to Oakland and the surrounding communities
seeking shelter.  Under pressure from the city of Berkeley, the University of California allowed
construction of an emergency shelter on the College Homestead, property previously reserved for
future University housing between the Sather Gate and Dwight Way.[1](#1)  The shelter was built
between Dwight Way and Haste Street just east of Ellsworth Avenue.  The property is on a north
to south descending grade, so the south end of the building is four stories high, with the north half
of three stories resting on a crawlspace about two feet high.  The frame is a basic balloon frame
on a concrete foundation, many of the principal beams being debris from the San Francisco
earthquake.  Some of the largest joists, particularly the floor joists above the ground story, have
almost an inch of charred wood as a skin, which may seem dangerous but actually makes the
beams more difficult to burn.  Fourteen apartments were constructed on each of the top three
floors, and on the shortened ground floor were possibly seven more.  At the very center of the
building was an open rotunda with a spiral staircase, about half as wide as the building.  Two
other staircases are located near the center of the north and south halves of the building, rising to
the roof.  At each end of Barrington two fire escapes stand at the ends of the corridors that run
lengthwise through the structure, so it has an abundance of easy access to all points on every
floor.  (See Floor Plans 1-5)

The shelter was pragmatic, possibly even temporary structure, at the time of construction
the largest residential building in Berkeley.[2](#2)  Rather than proving a white elephant, however, it
became the harbinger of great changes for the city.  A massive shift of population to the cities of
America was taking place from every part of the world, as well as the general trend of people
moving west to California.[3](#3)  Even though San Francisco was quickly rebuilt across the Bay, the
tide of people and the growth of the University continued rapidly to increase the population of
Berkeley, which had doubled in just a few years.  The Cerone Family, a wealthy sugar family from
Oakland, recognized this trend and bought several apartment houses in the East Bay as
investments.  One was the shelter for earthquake refugees on Dwight Way, which they named the
Lafayette Apartments.[4](#4)  The building was quickly remodeled to accommodate a new breed of
Berkeleyites.

The dominant force in architecture just before World War I was the City Beautiful, the
philosophy of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, an influential architecture school of the time.
Since the end of the Civil War the United States had sought to become a world power; the nation
was an industrial giant, a military might, and an imperialist force to rival the old empires of
Europe.  During the same era, the frontier was beginning to close, railroads and telegraph lines
bound cities together, and mechanization permitted thousands to move from the country to the
city in search of new work in manufacturing.  With such a massive shift from rural domesticity to
urban grandeur, a new style of architecture dominated, especially after the introduction of the
skyscraper, thanks to the elevator and reinforced steel construction.  At the same time,
government and non-profit institutions were becoming larger and more stable in the United
States, as Reconstruction ended.  It was known, even then, as a “gilded age”.

This new style of architecture was a national one that unified the far-flung regionalism of
the United States into a single edifice of Technology and Power:  the Beaux-Arts.  The Parisian
Beaux-Arts migrated across the Atlantic Ocean with architects like H.H. Richardson and Richard
Hunt, who brought the rational neo-classicism of Viollet-le-Duc to America.[5](#5)  The Beaux-Arts
became an ideal symbol of ancient prestige, power and integrity to the Rockefellers and
Vanderbilts who desired it; its intelligent mixture of Grecian, Roman, Renaissance and other
Classical forms were meant to represent Beauty itself in a pure form.[6](#6)

America, however, altered the central ideas of Beaux-Arts to fit an age of rapid
construction and expensive labor.[7](#7)  Capitalism demanded prestige, but at a price affordable to the
masses.  Instead of marble and stone, brick and wood were made to appear like stone, a violation
of the Parisian school’s intention to create a City Beautiful, but also a city that would endure.[8](#8)
The Cerones followed the local trends in design and in engineering, understandable considering
the lack of building resources following the San Francisco earthquake and then the onset of World
War I.  Their apartment building already had the distinction of being the largest in Berkeley, and
with an inexpensive Beaux-Arts façade it would radiate the concept of beauty in American
architecture initiated by A. T. Downing in the 1840s,[9](#9) thrown into public prominence by the grand
Chicago Columbian Exhibition of 1893.[10](#10)  After all, only a few blocks away the great Beaux-Arts
buildings of John Galen Howard were changing the face of the University of California campus.
Howard had been a student of Richardson; with this heart of the Beaux-Arts beating so close to
the Cerones’ Lafayette Apartments, how could it become anything else but a Beaux-Arts
structure itself?  Such a design would make apartment living on such a large scale palatable to
both students and professors at the nearby Berkeley campus; many other examples from this
period abound in Berkeley and across the Bay Area.  The exterior of the Lafayette was clothed in
redwood, cut and painted to resemble the stone masonry of the University.  (See Photos 7, 8, 9,
15)

I must note though, that the ornamentation on the building was not as extensive as on
Wheeler Hall, Howard’s masterpiece (Photo 9).  In this case frugality saved the Lafayette from
being overdone.  It was late enough in the Beaux-Arts period for architects to feel the pressures
of Modernism, just as the Art Nouveau had devastated the Beaux-Arts influence in Paris,[11](#11) and
the simplicity of the Bay Area School also had an impact.  Craftsman architects like Maybeck and
the Greene brothers preached the beauty of naked wood, and they too became major stylistic
leaders in California, while Howard decorated the University.[12](#12)  The resulting amalgam just before
World War I was Beaux-Arts with a Mediterranean influence, the first of many stylistic
concessions the building then called the Lafayette was to see.[13](#13)  The interior boasted redwood
paneling and hand-turned banisters, and like many Berkeley apartment houses tried to capture the
open-air feeling of a Greene and Greene sleeping terrace with an open central rotunda and
exterior roll-beds.  The roll-beds in particular were a short-lived but interesting addition to many
California apartments; built half-in and half-out on an outer wall, by getting in and rolling the
cover over, you could sleep outside, if a bit precariously.  (Photos 7, 8, 10, 11)  The exterior of
the building may have appeared vaguely regal, but on the inside it was still firmly rooted in Bay
Area tradition.  A building meant to house almost fifty families could hardly ignore the feeling of
community and environmentalism that even then had begun to seize the Bay Area.  Decades
before Barrington Hall or the USCA, the Lafayette had started to reflect the group needs of
residents over the prevailing architectural trends of the day.

By 1935 the Lafayette Apartments was in a state of disrepair.  The disastrous North
Berkeley fire of 1923 forced even more refugees into South Berkeley, and the popularity of the
automobile and the Key System streetcars (which went down Dwight Way in front of the
Lafayette) turned the city into a direct suburb of San Francisco.  Telegraph Avenue was rapidly
being redeveloped into the urban area it is today.  For unknown reasons the Cerones could no
longer afford to maintain the apartment house; it had become a gigantic firetrap, with the aged
redwood facade ready to go up like a match and the central rotunda a veritable chimney.  World
sugar production expanded rapidly in the early 20th century, capped by Cuban independence,
driving down prices, and with the beginning of the Great Depression, the Cerones were
undoubtedly in serious economic straits.  With no one else willing to save it, the Lafayette was
leased to the young University Students Cooperative Association, which had opened the original
Barrington Hall at 2714 Ridge Road in 1933.  Armed with their own tools and the new idea of
student cooperativism, the USCA made the Lafayette Apartments their new Central Office (CO)
and renamed it Barrington Hall, the name of their first cooperative house.[14](#14)  That Barrington had
probably been named for the Barrington Apartment Association in New York City, one of the
earliest cooperative “home clubs” in the United States, organized in 1882.[15](#15)  Where that name
originates is even more uncertain, although it may relate to an older co-op in England or in the
mill-town of Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

Student cooperativism was not the most radical movement in Berkeley during the time.
The city had already been governed by a Socialist mayor, and in the heart of the Great Depression
radicalism festered everywhere.  The students of the USCA did come together for activist
reasons, however; not only for financial benefits, but for what founder Harry Kingman called “a
new way of living together”.[16](#16)  The USCA wanted camaraderie different from the fraternities, one
with self-government and diversity.  There was no pledge week, no hazing; anyone willing to live
and work with 182 fellow students was welcome.  Over 1935 the members of the new Barrington
demolished the ground floor apartments to build a communal kitchen and dining room, even
though they could have afforded to keep the existing apartment kitchens, needing only a
communal storage space for food.  The space they gained by turning the upstairs kitchens into
extra bedrooms was lost by demolishing the downstairs apartments.  But the residents wanted to
eat together, as an expression of the cooperative ethos.

The house remained a firetrap, without the money to renovate.  Nevertheless, the
Barringtonians seemed a satisfied, rowdy bunch.  They disrupted the annual Big C Parade with a
float entitled “Hoover’s Last Erection”[17](#17) and caused the city of Berkeley to criminalize water-
ballooning when their constant indulgence in that sport demolished the windshield of a police car
on Dwight Way.[18](#18)

Other than continued success as a large cooperative house, not remarkable considering the
explosion is college attendance during the period, there were no significant changes at Barrington
until 1967.  This may seem an odd statement, but I am speaking in terms of the social community
relating to the changing building and its architecture.  In 1941 World War II came and Barrington
Hall fell empty as the male students went off to fight.  The building was leased at a minimal rate in
1943 to the Federal Public Housing Authority (FPHA) for seven years, in exchange for badly
needed renovations of the entire structure.  The FPHA removed the redwood paneling inside and
out, covering the outer walls with fireproof stucco and the inside with commercial gypsum
boards.  The joists were reinforced with steel I-beams.  The rotunda and spiral staircase were
removed, replaced with two new stairwells and a brick firewall across the center of the building.
Finally the suites were turned back into single family apartments and given to Navy workers at the
Liberty Shipyard in Richmond, a few miles away by streetcar.[19](#19)

The USCA returned in 1950 after seven years to a completely remodeled Barrington,
much sturdier and unintentionally modern in appearance, through virtue of the façade being
removed.  Again lack of money strangely kept Barrington in fashion—first economy had tempered
the ornamentation of the Beaux-Arts facade, and now economy prevented anything from marring
the blankest façade but white stucco.  In a way the cooperative had no need for a facade, and
decorating the outside was never discussed in council meetings; in fact, the original street
entrance was sealed and a six-foot wall erected along Dwight Way, so Barrington was obviously
not interested in opening to the outside world, but rather turned in upon itself.  The kitchens were
once again removed from the individual suites for additional bedrooms, and common areas
developed on the ground floor, including the communal kitchen.  And in 1967, that common
interior finally began to show some signs of social adjustment.

The decision was made in 1966 to convert Barrington to a co-ed house.  The progression
of events seen in the minutes of the Barrington Hall Council meetings from 1964 to 1967 show
increasing disenchantment with the government of the house and the USCA in general.  The
USCA had moved its main office from the ground floor of Barrington to the new Ridge Project
across campus on the Northside.  Isolated in the continual uproar of the Southside Sixties along
Telegraph Avenue, Barrington started to rebel against centralized control.  The system of electing
representatives to Council was abolished, with any member choosing to attend having the right to
vote.  The Judiciary Committee or J-Comm, the internal court system of Barrington Hall, was
dissolved.[20](#20)  With the changeover to co-ed, many rules governing “proper” student behavior were
abolished, leaving minor details such as how many pieces of cake to eat and where to eat them to
the discretion of the members.

The coming of women to the house immediately caused everyone to “loosen up”.  Unlike
a co-ed dormitory, where men and women share a common and are paired into rooms, students in
Barrington were grouped into suites of two to five people, as well as working together at cleaning
or cooking.  The house could not be divided by sex easily, even if there had been a desire to, as
people who had lived in the cooperative longest had the most “points” and therefore could have
the pick of any room in the house, regardless of who their suitemates were.  New high-fidelity
stereos began to blast through the thin walls that had once separated quietly studying men, but by
the late 1960s students found more to do than study anyway.  Notice the difference in room
access between Barrington and the plans of typical dormitories.  (Plans 1-8)  Everyone in a suite
was channeled through a single foyer into several bedrooms and came into frequent contact—if
this had not been the intention, the house would probably have been redesigned after women were
allowed in.  Typically men and women were paired in the doubles, with a member of the same sex
in the walk-through singles (which can be accessed only through a double.)  But as noted, regular
singles were up for grabs to the person with the most points, and by the 1980s some couples did
arrange to occupy doubles, so the mix of singles and couples, men and women in most suites was
unusually diverse even for Berkeley student life.

Possibly the most significant cultural alteration in the house began with the painting of the
Yellow Submarine mural on the wall across from the second floor landing of the south stairwell.
Inspired by the Beatles and the psychedelic drugs coming over the Bay Bridge from the Summer
of Love in Haight-Ashbury, murals were gradually painted in the halls after 1968, until by the
early 1980s there was not a single white wall in any of Barrington’s commons areas, the halls,
dining rooms, council rooms, the study rooms, the roof, etc.  The appearance of community art
marked Barrington as culturally curious, even rebellious.  The building, with help from the
residents, manifested a peculiar environment, in effect welcoming drug experimenters, political
radicals, musicians and artists into a contained space.  The blank exterior façade and wall across
what had been the entrance enforced a sense of separation or cliquishness, while the unusual co-
ed layout of the suites and the painted hallways advertised a safe haven for the counterculture.

By the time of the People’s Park Riots in May of 1969, Barrington Hall was an infamous
place in Berkeley.  The devotion to cooperation in a nation committed to competition bore radical
fruit after thirty-five years.  Barrington became a “safe house” for deviance, good or ill.  It was
safe for unmarried men and women to live together, safe to paint and draw on the walls, safe to
do or sell any drug, safe to crash in if you had no other place to stay.  Of course, not everyone
living in the house agreed with this lifestyle, in 1970 or in 1990.  But Barrington Hall is a large
building, with almost 130 bedrooms, multiple stairwells, a large accessible roof, and until 1983 a
closed-in backwater on the ground floor where anyone could do anything unobserved.  The main
entrance was located off the dining room, meaning that most the traffic south of the dining room
was simply crossing the five feet to the south stairs.  (Plan 4)  The rest of this common area was
essentially a hotel for street people, and the anarchic government of the house was unconcerned.
After all, thousands of hippies poured into the Bay Area for the Summer of Love and remained
throughout the campus rioting at Berkeley and San Francisco State University.  Barrington caught
the eye of radicals by banning police from the house after they ran through the halls in 1968, and
the local chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was formed in the building.
Barrington became the capital of Berkeley’s counterculture, and even as recently as the 1980s was
the home of the SAFE organization against fee increases and the Biko Plaza News, the
underground press of the anti-apartheid movement during the occupation of Sproul Plaza on
campus.

The exterior facade was still ignored by those living inside throughout the 1970s.  It was a blank
face to the outside world, cutting the structure off from the street, the neighbors and the auto
traffic up Dwight; the streetcar was long gone.  The building was unsecured and open, if not
inviting, to pedestrian traffic, but wild murals and garbage on the interior were as effective as an
electrified fence in keeping out the “uncool”.  The residents apparently had the situation where
they wanted it, and by simply maintaining the appearance of the building as the status quo, the
new members were confined within certain limits of personality, a new radical “norm” which
made the residents highly compatible.  Ritual and romance rose up over the dying 1960s, and this
new Barrington spirit carried through the culturally vacant 1970s into the changes of 1980s.  The
building, in essence, had created its own perpetual legacy.

In passing I should note the one physical change made in this period, the conversion of
Suite 212 into the Alternative Kitchen.  This room, quietly tucked away on the second floor, is the
abode of the house’s vegetarians, and the “AK” was the only construction meant to accommodate
a new type of resident.

In 1970 the USCA decided to decentralize its budget, which permitted the houses to
spend as they pleased against a budget, rather than being allotted money from the Central Office
(CO).  With aggressive fundraising and growth, the co-op was over a thousand members and
unwieldy for such centralized control; there was also much suspicion of authority in the USCA
and Berkeley in general with the violent end of the 1960s.  In retrospect the complete
decentralization was a major error on the part of the CO.  No one at any of the houses was
properly trained to handle their own budgets, and the more anarchic houses went thousands of
dollars over budget.  Through seniority, the most skilled managers had left the large houses for
smaller co-ops like Davis House or Rochdale Village, the apartment complex completed by the
USCA in 1971.  Barrington Hall kept afloat financially in the late 1970s by becoming an
unlicensed nightclub on Saturday nights.  Fatefully coinciding with the rise of punk rock,
Barrington provided one of the only venues for early punk bands in the Bay Area.  Influential
groups such as X, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys played their first Berkeley shows at
Barrington, and the money charged at the door kept the house in the financial black.  In addition a
new type of student, confrontational young punks, were thus attracted to the house.  Times were
changing.  Like hippies in the 1960s, punk was a reaction to growing conservatism in the United
States, and this conservatism began to pressure Barrington.  The blank façade sported such
graffiti as “Go Away” and “Fuck You All”, and the house finally suffered a backlash.  The
neighboring Elsmere Apartments took the house to court over noise complaints in 1982, and the
nightclub was closed.  To make matters worse, the drugs of choice in the United States, Berkeley
and Barrington changed from the more artistic and benign marijuana and LSD to the destructive
cocaine and heroin.  Without revenue from the shows and increasing embezzlement by drug
addicts in management, Barrington’s finances fell rapidly into the red.

In 1983 the first “rehabilitation” of the house took place under the guidance of the CO,
who realized sixteen years too late that they had lost control of the larger co-ops.  Beyond some
minor cosmetic changes, a major effort was made to change the building culturally.  Compare
Plans 4 and 5 as we see what the Central Office tried to accomplish.

The Study Room was moved from the ground floor to Suite 304 to make it slightly more
comfortable, but primarily to eliminate the former Study Room as a hiding place for street people,
as it had been the most isolated room in the house.  The TV Room, another “den of iniquity”, was
removed from the building altogether and turned into a Bicycle Room.  The office was enlarged
to establish a stronger administrative presence in the anarchic house, although there was still no
guidance on management from the CO.  The Switchboard was moved to the new entryway onto
Dwight Way.  The old Switch, next to the south stairwell, was a popular hang-out, with much of
the building’s evening traffic passing by.  After the 1983 rehab it could only be accessed through
the Bike Room and stood guard over the entry, one of the new responsibilities of the switchboard
operator.

Most significantly, the Entryway was moved from the side of the house to the front once
again, to end the backwater around the lounge and to improve the façade of the building, which it
admittedly did.  Barrington Hall now opened onto Dwight Way instead of the parking lot, as it
originally had for decades, and resembled a normal apartment building.  There was no longer any
“hiding” in the Lounge, which in a sense became the foyer of the structure.  The result was
something of a backlash on the part of the residents.  Barrington was our home—we had thought
we had made it, and more importantly, it had made many of us; for some people it irrevocably
changed their lives, good or bad.  The social activities of the building reflected our attachment to
the cooperative and its recent history.  Studying was usually done in the central dining room, not
the isolated Study Room on the third floor.  Even three years after the Rehab, when this study
was completed, most residents entered the building through the parking lot door (usually propped
open) into the dining room, the public space where most people congregated, while the locked
entry on Dwight remained quiet.  Parties were rarely held in rooms, but in the dining room or
often in the hallways, where to get through you might have forded a tangle of thirty or forty legs
in the dark.  All of the stairwells were coated with graffiti, these common areas being the
barometers of house opinion.  The Lounge remained dormant except for occasional movies on TV
and the Council, the rowdy Sunday night meeting where anyone interested came to make
decisions on house policy and catch up on the week’s gossip.

A second rehabilitation occurred in the summer of 1986, when the structure was emptied,
cleaned and repainted.  Drug abuse and dealing in the house had reached a chronic level, and both
two overdoses and many continuing complaints by the neighbors created interest in Barrington
from the police and the City Council.  At the same time the city of Berkeley was transforming,
becoming wealthier and more conservative as San Francisco grew exponentially through the “dot
bomb” of 2000.  Younger visitors, most of high school age, began to tear up Telegraph Avenue
and places like Barrington Hall in the early 1980s; their graffiti spread from the stairwells and
began to destroy the historic murals themselves.  With the liability insurance of the entire
cooperative on the line, it was only a matter of time before Barrington Hall was closed to
students, leased and completely painted, inside and out, after a violent confrontation with the
police.  The only surviving murals are the “Last Supper” in the AK and some minor graffiti in the
Maintenance Room.  And two other houses, Cloyne Court and the Chateau, have both come
under similar scrutiny—evidence that Barrington was not the cause of its own destruction, but
simply the first victim of its size and the mismanagement of the USCA.

Barrington Hall was not a work of art.  Barrington was a building we painted and used as
best we could to be a cooperative house.  People vented their feelings by kicking holes in the
walls, and then showed their devotion to the house by lovingly repairing and decorating the walls.
The Central Office tried to reorganize the commons to subdue us, converted doubles and
walkthroughs into singles to isolate us, but nothing worked.  The architect Robert Venturi
described symbolism in architecture as the major visual form of communication.  I would extend
this statement further and claim architecture itself to be a kind of communication, if it is flexible
enough.  Why else would we say, “building a wall between us”?  We transform space, and
architecture organizes that space.  Simple ideas, but in writing of Barrington’s “style”, we lose
sight of the simple facts.  Barrington was just a large apartment building.  Instead of broadcasting
a single style, it was stripped bare, providing an ideal canvas for individual style; our space
flaunting itself, saying THIS IS OUR HOUSE, but in Barrington Hall our energies were not
devoted to the style of most significant features of our façade.  If you study the house carefully,
the most salient original feature is the pattern of the windows, the design of the openings to the
interior, but we did not modify the windows, because the message THIS IS OUR HOUSE was
directed towards ourselves and our guests.  The house was our primary method of communicating
our unity as a cooperative, as we were all contained within its filth and its beauty.  Throughout
the long history of Barrington Hall it has been adapted, not so much to any vague notion of style,
but to the defined needs of those who live within.  The Beaux-Arts façade of 1906 was simply a
concession to a time of patriotic rebuilding and classical rebirth in the Bay Area.  When the
building was the Lafayette, it was designed to centralize the occupants of each apartment (as in
the modern plan 8) through the spiral staircase; later the design was configured to centralize the
entire building into the downstairs commons.  We took full advantage of what we had been given,
because we felt the house was ours.  We spoke to each other through the medium of Barrington
Hall, and indeed, because of this dialogue the house spoke back.  To the discredit of all of us, we
made Barrington vulnerable to the changes going on around it, and the house as a community
ceased to exist.  But the building still exists, a long gray battleship between Dwight Way and
Haste Street, and until the last Barringtonian is gone, I hope it will persist in our dreams.

1. The south side and main entrance to Barrington Hall, at 2315 Dwight Way.  The building
   was sheltered behind two healthy trees, later removed, and a small garden, as opposed to the six-
   foot concrete wall that fronted the sidewalk until l983.  Notice how the original balconies were
   removed from the front in 1943, the only balcony now being the metal fire escape of the first
   floor.  The façade of the ground floor—windows, overhang, doorway and mural—were new.
   This space was sealed between 1943 and 1983.
2. The north side of Barrington Hall facing Haste Street.  Here you see more clearly details
   of the fire escape and the bay windows.  The door opened into the first floor, as the ground floor
   only reaches the center of the building due to a north-south grade.  On the roof two of the four
   sets of solar panels added in 1985 are visible.
3. The west side of Barrington Hall, and the parking lot.  The entrance from 1943 to 1983
   was under the overhanging roof; this became a secondary entrance.
4. The east side of Barrington Hall, showing clearly the unusual size of the building.  Notice
   the various “additions” to the exterior, such as the new steps on the left, the exhaust tower for the
   boiler room and the horizontal pipes carrying water from the solar panels to the boiler.
5. Part of the roof.  This view is towards the southeast.  The white shed was the original
   laundry room (1935), the wooden shed being a 1983 addition.  The smaller unpainted wooden
   box was a sauna.  The top of one of the eight airshafts can be seen in the foreground.  The firewall
   installed in 1943 juts up on the right, being crossed by a stile.  This stile, built by this author in
   1984, remains to this day.  The solar panels are directly behind you.  There are two access points
   to the roof, the north and south stairwells.
6. Barrington as seen from between two of her neighbors.  The amusing collection of pipes,
   bars and windows made our home look rather like an oil refinery or a pretentious art museum.
7. Barrington Hall, south entrance, in 1935, shortly after it was leased to the USCA.  The
   façade is original from 1906, except for the missing capitals.  The façade is redwood painted to
   imitate the Beaux-Arts style of John Galen Howard.
8. A building similar to Barrington Hall, but somewhat smaller, on Channing Way west of
   Dana Street.  The roll-beds have been converted to balconies.
9. John Galen Howard’s Wheeler Hall, on the Berkeley Campus.  This structure came twelve
   years after Barrington was finished, but shows fairly well what the Cerones wanted to imitate.
   The half-pillars flanking the arched window are most typical of Barrington’s Beaux-Arts
   “gingerbread”.
10. A roll-bed, at Treehaven on Ridge Road east of Euclid Avenue.
11. More roll-beds on Dana north of Haste Street.
12. The lovely view from a standard Barrington window.  This was my room; I love the urban
    life.
13. More amusing fenestration patterns in the USCA.  This is the back of Stebbins Hall, a
    contemporary of Barrington on Ridge Road.
14. “Barrington Ineptitude #447”.  A souvenir of the stuccoing of 1943.  Such mistakes, like
    sealing a faucet, are not uncommon in any stuccoing.
15. Another anonymous contemporary of Barrington Hall, in the golden age of the apartment
    house.

<h2 id="floor-plans-and-miscellany">Floor Plans and Miscellany</h2>

1. Barrington Hall, first floor.
2. Barrington Hall, second floor.
3. Barrington Hall, third floor.
4. Barrington Hall, ground floor, 1983.
5. Barrington Hall, ground floor, after the rehabilitation of 1983. Pay particular attention to
   the changes in traffic patterns.
6. A typical room conversion, from apartment to cooperative suite. Notice how space is maximized
   and personal interaction becomes almost mandatory.
7. The floor plans of two college dormitories. The residents are much more effectively isolated
   in these buildings from one another.
8. A modern apartment house very much like Barrington. People living in different bedrooms are
   directed into the center of the apartment by the design.
9. A cheerful welcome note, dated a year after the rehabilitation of 1983. The shadier side of
   Barrington Hall has been left out.
10. The USCA contract from 1984.
